This project implements a fashion object detection model and can classify into 10 different categories using **YOLOv8** to identify and classify various clothing items in images, such as tops, pants, dresses, and accessories.

## Sample

## âœ¨ Features

- Detection of 10 fashion categories including: sunglasses, hats, jackets, shirts, pants, shorts, skirts, dresses, bags, and shoes
- Preprocessing of image data and YOLO format annotations
- Custom training pipeline with YOLOv8
- Evaluation metrics and performance visualization
- Inference capabilities for new images

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project uses the Colorful Fashion Dataset for Object Detection, which includes:

- Images of fashion items in various settings
- YOLO format annotations (class_id, x_center, y_center, width, height)
- 10 fashion categories
- Train/validation/test splits

The dataset structure is organized as follows:

```
colorful_fashion_dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ JPEGImages/           # Image files (.jpg)
â”œâ”€â”€ Annotations_txt/      # YOLO format annotations (.txt)
â””â”€â”€ ImageSets/Main/       # Train/test/val splits
    â”œâ”€â”€ trainval.txt
    â””â”€â”€ test.txt
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

After training for 40 epochs, the model achieved the following performance metrics:
